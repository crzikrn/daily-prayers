    <h3>Prayer upon Rising from Sleep</h3>
    <p>
My God, Father, and Saviour, since you have been pleased to give me the grace to come
through the night to the present day, now grant that I may employ it entirely in your
service, so that all my works may be to the glory of your name and the edification of my
neighbours. As you have been pleased to make your sun shine upon the earth to give us
bodily light, grant the light of your Spirit to illumine my understanding and my heart.
And because it means nothing to begin well if one does not persevere, I ask that you
would continue to increase your grace in me until you have led me into full communion
with your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who is the true Sun of our souls, shining day and
night, eternally and without end. Hear me, merciful Father, by our Lord Jesus Christ, <span id="italic">Amen</span>.</p>

     <h3>Prayer after the Midday Meal</h3>
    <p>
O Lord God, I give you thanks for all the benefits and gifts you constantly shower on
me. Thank you for sustaining my physical life through food and shelter; for giving me
new life through the gospel; and for the certainty of the best and perfect life, which is
yet to come. In light of all these blessings, I ask that you would not allow my affections
to be tangled in inordinate desires for the things of this world, but let me always set my
heart on things above, where Christ, who is my life, is seated at your right hand. Hear
      me, merciful Father, by our Lord Jesus Christ, <span id="italic">Amen</span>.</p>

   <div id="evening">
    <h1><em>Hey there, Good Evening!</em></h1>  
    <h3>Prayer before Sleep</h3>
    <p>
O Lord God, now grant me the grace not only to rest my body this night, but to have
my spiritual repose, in soul and conscience, in your grace and love, that I may let go of
all earthly cares so I might be comforted and eased in all ways. And because no day
passes that I do not sin in so many ways, please bury all my offences in your mercy, that
I might not lose your presence. Forgive me, merciful Father, for Christ's sake. And as I
lay down in sleep to safely awake again only by your grace, keep me in a joyful, lively
remembrance that whatever happens, I will someday know my final rising—the
resurrection—because Jesus Christ lay down in death for me, and rose for my
justification. In his name I pray <span id="italic">Amen</span>.</p>
